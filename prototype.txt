what is constructor?

Using this constructor you can create an object. Constructor every time creating new object.

exmaple

var person = function (name,age){
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
    this.callname = function(){
        return this.name
}
}
var person1 = new person("noor")
var person2 = new person("saif")
console.log (person1.callname())
console.log (person2.callname())


 since person1 and person2 instence of person
 they are actually distinct objects which means two
 seprated objects they created person so it inherits all 
 the property all the methods 

person is a parent class 
person1 is child class
